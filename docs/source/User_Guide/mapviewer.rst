Visualization of raster layers for selected weather and biophysical indicators and anomalies
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

The system's mapviewer houses a number of layers. Each layer can be displayed on the map through toggling it on and off. A legend will be displayed on the right 
for each layer that has been activated.

For multilayers, a secondary layer will appear on the legend which can also be toggled on and off. 

To facilitate better image interpretation, it is possible to change the opacity for activated layers within the legend (1). It is also possible to 
rearrange the order of activated layers(2) by dragging them from to top or bottom on the legend.
