Introduction
==============

This section describes the basic information necessary to perform system maintenance functions, such as adding static page content to on the system pages, styling, 
activating and publishing layers displayed on the mapviewer, adding or updating layer metadata information, specifying layer time interval and symbology type, etc. 

This guide will begin with a walkthrough of the Content Management Systemâ€™s elements and functionalities, followed by a guide on how to update static content and finally describe mapviewer layer maintenance procedures.

The Content Management System is built upon Wagtail, an open source content management system based on the Django framework and designed to be super easy to use for both developers and editors.
